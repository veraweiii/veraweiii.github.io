            This is a typeface I designed called "Evolution." I used Processing.js to generate the type. Since the lines
            and
            shapes comprising each letter is generated using a random algorithm, the letters will appear differently
            each time
            you type it. Ideally, I would be able to display the use of this interactive typeface in a physical gallery,
            where
            users will be able to see how the type is animated and becomes more distorted as they press a key for a
            longer period of time.

            This is a platform game I designed using a software called GDevelop. The idea is that each level of the game 
            presents a different cultural theme. In the demo shown, one level has a Japanese theme, whereas the other has a French theme. 
            Users can use a keyboard to control the character's movement. The objective of the game is to collect coins and defeat the 
            enemy creatures by jumping on them.

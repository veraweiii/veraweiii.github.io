  <h1>Welcome to my personal website!</h1>
  <div class="main">
    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <p>I am Vera Wei and my pronouns are she/her/hers.
      I'm a senior at UW-Madison majoring in computer science and psychology, as well as pursuing a certificate in
      graphic design.
      Although I was born in North Carolina, I lived in Beijing, China for about six years across elementary and middle
      school.
      I'm a little sad that the pandemic has curbed the possibility of face-to-face social interaction, but I've also
      found ways to
      keep myself occupied with my hobbies. Some of my hobbies include drawing on my iPad, binge-watching shows,
      listening to music,
      and cooking. If you're interested in knowing more information, please refer to

        resume</a>.

        <h2>It's Okay to Not Be Okay (2020)</h2>

        <p>
            "It's Okay to Not Be Okay" is the romantic fantasy comedy of a caregiver of a psychiatric ward who refuses
            to love because of his heavy responsibilities and of a fairy tale writer who doesn't know about love because of the way she was born and raised. The two will meet
            and embrace and heal each other's wounds. I recommend this drama because it features a very strong and powerful female lead, 
            which isn't typical of Korean dramas. There are also many discussions around mental health and emotional vulnerability, which I personally found very empowering.

        <h2>Flower of Evil (2020)</h2>

        <p>
            Taking a thrilling plot, Flower of Evil revolves around the story of a psychopath who turned a new leaf
            leaving his old vile identity. However, his wife who is a police officer delves to unearth the truth about
            him. I recommend this drama because it has both elements of suspense and romance, keeping me on the edge of 
            my seat throughout the entire show. Things get really interesting after the first few episodes, so don't get 
            discouraged by the beginning of the show, which doesn't reveal the bigger picture.
